  <h1>Careers</h1>
  <p>When I began building this website, I was a freshman in college pursuing a degree in Computer Science. My primary goal was to challenge myself by applying what I was learning in class to a real-world project. Through this experience, I aimed to enhance my coding abilities, improve my understanding of web development, and develop stronger skills in organizing and managing code efficiently.

This platform became more than just a personal learning projectâ€”it evolved into a meaningful tool designed to help others. I wanted to create something that could genuinely benefit users by offering stock and cryptocurrency tracking features that support smarter investment decisions.

Looking ahead, I hope to continue improving this website by integrating more advanced features and expanding its functionality. Ultimately, my aspiration is to build a career in technology where I can develop impactful tools that empower individuals and solve real-world problems.
